# Simple Todo and Goals app with React and Redux .

### Here Actions files calling from reducers then reducers calling from store, Passing this store to React provider .

### How handle state get , update and listen ??

Main state is lives in Reducers, So in this simple app, I'm put it in index file under reducers folder and  
 using actions and connect function in Redux to manage states,So we could get, update and listening state.
